    <p class="title-item">In 2024, a client was referred to me through a mutual connection, explaining that his friend was looking for a logo for a health, nutrition, and fitness-related purpose. The client had a clear vision for the design—a red, anatomically accurate heart with a 
        lightning bolt through it, where the veins of the heart would be visible in a modern, minimalist style. He had already provided a reference image to illustrate his concept, which was incredibly helpful in initiating the design process, as visual references personally assist 
        me greatly in transforming ideas into impactful designs.

<div class="casemiddle">
  <div class="middle-item"><a href="/rumpanbar/logo.jpg"><img src="/rumpanbar/logo.jpg"  alt=""></a></div>

  <div class="middle-item"><p>The design process began by using what knowledge I had about the bar, such as it being a pop and rock bar, the client's preferred option for the name (which was rumpan bar) - and combining these with my own research and knowledge about the pop and rock scene.
  In our initial conversations, we discussed whether "Rumpan" (which translates to "backside" in English) should take center stage in the logo, given the bar's more bold and edgy vibe. With creative freedom in hand, I developed concepts that both leaned into this theme
  as well as alternatives that took a subtler approach. One design element I felt drawn to was a vibrant magenta pink, which ultimately found its place in the final logo. The initial design proposals can be seen on the left.

<div class="middle-item"><p>Another part of the project involved suggesting potential names for the bar, as "Rumpan Bar" was not yet finalized. I explored a range of creative directions, from dopamine-inspired concepts to more abstract, unconventional ideas. My personal favorite, 
  "Lower the Bar," incorporates a barcode into the logo, adding layers of meaning. The barcode, a familiar societal symbol, subtly nods to themes of consumer culture—something often critiqued in alternative subcultures—while playing on the phrase "Raise the Bar." By flipping the 
  expression, it sparks reflection on expectations and norms while also serving as a subtle signal to the crowd it wants to attract.</p></div>

  <div class="final-item"><p>The color palette defined during the design concept phase can be seen below. At this stage, the client expressed interest in exploring how the logo might look with boule balls integrated into the design, which led me to develop these variations. While the 
    logos and concepts I presented were not selected for final use, they contributed to shaping the overall visual direction, particularly influencing the official color palette and typography choices.</p>
