        <div class="title-item"><p>In 2025, what I first thought was a creative block turned out to be a push toward something new. 
            I needed an outlet where I could be as creative as possible — and that search led me to 3D design. What started in 
            frustration quickly became inspiration, and I discovered exactly what I had been missing.
            Since then, I’ve fallen hard for 3D design, especially crafting game-like environment scenes. My inspirations often
             come from series and games — with Breaking Bad and GTA playing a big role in shaping the kind of worlds I love to 
             create.</p></div></div>

        <source src="3DDESIGN/gasani.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><p>This is my take on the classic desert gas station scene — but with a twist. 
          I wanted it to feel like more than just an empty stop; it’s a crime scene with a story. 
          The police have been here, something valuable was left behind, and someone has already broken back in to get it. That’s why the barrier tape is torn, 
          hinting at something unsettling inside. For this project I focused heavily on lighting — using point lights and combining complementary colors (orange
           against blue-green tones) to create a contrast that feels both cold and strangely inviting. The warm glow cuts through the scene, adding tension and 
           drawing the eye exactly where I want it. To push it further, I animated subtle details like flickering lights and spinning ventilation fans, giving 
           the environment an eerie sense of life. This project marks a clear step forward from my earlier 3D work, both in mood and technical execution — and I 
           loved getting lost in building its atmosphere.</p></div>
